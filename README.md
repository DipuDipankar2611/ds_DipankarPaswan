# Web3 Trading Team Data Science Assignment: Trader Behavior Insights

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between cryptocurrency trader behavior and Bitcoin market sentiment using two key datasets:  
- **Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid** (trades including profitability, leverage, volume, etc.)  
- **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset (Fear & Greed Index)**  

The objective is to explore how trader profitability, risk-taking, and volume align or diverge from the overall market sentiment and uncover actionable insights for smarter trading strategies.

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   The notebook includes necessary imports (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

3. **Load datasets:**  
   Ensure the CSV files are present in the `csv_files/` folder in your Google Drive or repo.

4. **Execute notebook cells:**  
   Run each cell sequentially to perform data loading, cleaning, aggregation, analysis, and visualization.

5. **View outputs:**  
   Charts and plots will be saved automatically in the `outputs/` folder.

## Key Deliverables & Results

- **Aggregated daily trader metrics by sentiment** (profit/loss, leverage, volume).
- **Visualizations showing relationships** between trader behavior and market sentiment.
- **Correlation heatmaps** illustrating patterns in data.
- **PDF report (`ds_report.pdf`)** summarizing insights and recommended strategies.

## Insights Summary

- Trader profit/loss is generally lower during Fear phases and higher during Greed phases.
- Leverage used by traders tends to increase when market sentiment is greedy, indicating riskier positions.
- Trading volume spikes during extreme Fear and Greed periods, reflecting herd behavior.
- Buy ratios increase during Greed phases.
- Some contrarian traders profit during Fear, highlighting opportunities for strategic positioning.
